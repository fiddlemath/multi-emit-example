# Reserve Protocol

The Reserve Protocol enables a class of token called RToken: self-issued tokens backed by a rebalancing basket of collateral. While the protocol enables any number of RTokens to be created, further discussion is limited to the characterization of a single RToken instance.

## Overview

RTokens can be minted by depositing a basket of _collateral tokens_, and redeemed for the basket as well. Thus, an RToken will tend to trade at the market value of the entire basket that backs it, as any lower or higher price could be arbitraged.

The definition of the collateral basket is set dynamically on a block-by-block basis with respect to a _reference basket_. While the RToken often does its internal calculus in terms of a single unit of account (USD), what constitutes appreciation is entirely a function of the reference basket.

RTokens can be insured, which means that if any of their collateral tokens default, there's a pool of value available to make up for the loss. RToken insurance is provided by Reserve Rights (RSR) holders, who may choose to stake their RSR on an RToken instance. Staked RSR can be seized in the case of a default, in a process that is entirely mechanistic based on on-chain price-feeds, and does not depend on governance votes or human judgment.

But markets do not insure holders for free. In order to incentivize RSR holders to stake in an RToken instance, each RToken instance can choose to offer an arbitrary portion of its revenue to be directed towards its RSR insurance pool. This simultaneously encourages staking in order to provision an insurance buffer, while increasing the size of that buffer over time.

As with any smart contract application, the actual behavior may vary from the intended behavior. It's safest to observe an application in use for a long period of time before trusting it to behave as expected. This overview describes its _intended_ behavior.
